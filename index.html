    <h3>THE BEGGINING</h3>
    <p>Once a saturday morning in the big garden of Olivia's house lived 3 dogs two german shepards and one golden retriver. 
    <b>Ninochca</b> (the german shepard girl) smelled a bounce of bones beside a lemon plant. She called her friends 
    <b>Maxi</b> (the german shepard boy) and 
    <b>Baloops</b> (the golden retriver boy) to help her.
